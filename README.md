# FB-BDs-to-iCal
Function: Extract Facebook Birthdays to an iCal file    
Reason: Facebook no longer supports subscriptions to birthdays to be used in other calendars    
Solution:  
Personal version:  
- Manually loading BDs page and forcing display all by page down until end - automate  
- Using console to paste and run javascript:  
  - set start month - automate  
  - outputs text to be copied to iCal, but  
    - with asterixes for this week's birthdays that I fix manually - automate  
- Links to profiles = a bonus!  
- Google Calendar adds crap to fetch page and probably tracks it...  
  - my getaround I mark link, right-click, and go to...
