# FB-BDs-to-iCal
Extract Facebook Birthdays to an iCal file  
Facebook no longer supports subscriptions to birthdays to be used in other calendars  
Personal version:  
	Manually loading BDs page and forcing display all by page down until end - automate  
	Using console to paste and run javascript:  
		set starts month - automize  
		outputs text to be copied to iCal, but  
			with asterixes for this week's birthdays - automate  
	Links to profiles = a bonus!  
		Google Calendar adds crap to fetch page and probably tracks it...  
			* I mark link, right-click, and go to...
